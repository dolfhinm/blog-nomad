    <p><strong>Nomad Knowledge</strong> is a home base for people who believe life doesn’t have to fit inside one location. We publish honest, actionable insights on earning remotely, handling visas and banking, and staying connected on the road.</p>

    <p>This isn’t another “quit your job and travel” blog. It’s for freelancers, founders, and remote pros who want freedom <em>and</em> stability - the systems that make a long-term nomad life work.</p>

    <h2>What you’ll find here</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Money</strong> - ways to earn, save, and invest while living globally.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobility</strong> - visas, logistics, and tools for borderless living.</li>
      <li><strong>Mindset</strong> - routines, health, and community on the move.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Grab your laptop, pick your next base, and design your own version of “home.”</p>
