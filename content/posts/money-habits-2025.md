Sticking to **good money habits** doesn't have to be perfect—just consistent. Here are five simple routines that work even when life gets noisy.

## 1) Automate savings on payday

Set an automatic transfer that moves a fixed amount to savings **the same day** your paycheck arrives. Treat savings like a bill.

**How to start**

- Pick a round number you won't notice (e.g., 5–10%).
- Use your bank's scheduled transfer tool.
- Increase by 1–2% after 2–3 months.

## 2) Use a “fun cap” (and enjoy it)

Give yourself a **weekly fun budget**. Swipe guilt-free until it's gone; then pause until next week. This keeps treats controlled—and fun.

**Make it easy**

- Move the fun money to a separate card or wallet.
- Rename the account “🎉 Fun Cap” for clarity.
- If you roll over, carry only 50% forward (avoid bloat).

## 3) One subscription in, one out

Before adding a new subscription, cancel or pause one you rarely use. This keeps fixed costs flat and forces you to pick what matters.

## 4) The 24‑hour click buffer

For non-urgent purchases, wait a day. If you still want it after 24 hours, buy it—no shame. You'll skip a lot of impulse buys.

## 5) Sunday Reset, 20 minutes

Once a week, scan transactions, check upcoming bills, and set one micro‑goal for the week (e.g., “bring lunch twice”). Keep it short.
